Hello.

## Who I Am

* Luca Etienne Schulz `les(\.?cx)?`
* [codeberg.org/les](https://codeberg.org/les)
* [github.com/lescx](https://github.com/lescx)

I am interested in:

* operating systems with focus on minimalism and/or security, especially:
  * [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org)
  * [Plan9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs)
  * [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org)
  * Sadly there isn't a *good* secureâ„¢ FOSS desktop operating system, so I also keep two eyes on Windows and macOS
* [CTFs](https://ctf101.org)
* infosec, security, \[anti]forensics
* programming languages:
  * Lisp, Scheme
  * Erlang, Elixir
  * C, Go, Rust
