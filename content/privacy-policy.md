# Privacy Policy

There is no tracking on this site. No cookies, no super-cookies, no fingerprinting, no canvas-fingerprinting.
I do not embed anything from third party sites - not even Cloudflare, AWS or other crap.
I don't use JavaScript. Everything is statically served on the server.
I don't have analytics on the site. The only thing I can see about how often my website is clicked is "my server uploaded 30GB of data today". That's it.

It's hosted by the friends from Karlsruhe, [netcup.de](https://netcup.de). My server is in Nuremberg.

The email is hosted by the lovely people at [mailbox.org] (https://mailbox.org) in Berlin.
