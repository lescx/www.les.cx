**Before contacting me, read the [Filter](#filter) section down below.**

If you have a good reason to contact me, you can reach me at [@les.cx:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@les.cx:matrix.org) on Matrix.

You can also contact me via email at [luca@les.cx](mailto:luca@les.cx) but I won't reply if you don't encrypt your message using [PGP](https://www.les.cx/.well-known/openpgpkey/hu/wbp7trgro48kdyd9oi1ykze9zj5hpqwb). Make sure I can find your public key and can verify your fingerprint.

Also, I use two strict email filter: one on software level, one on brain level. The second one also applies to Matrix.

## Filter

### Software-filter

The following emails end up in spam:

- HTML-formatted emails (use plaintext)
- Generic signatures such as 'Sent from my iPhone'
- Buzzword keyword filtering such as "Bitcoin", "NFT" or "AI"
- More than one "!"/"?" in succession.
- Email provider: Yahoo, web.de, GMX

### Brain-filter

The following messages end up in trash and the sender is permanently blocked:

- Crypto/NFT bullshit
- Advertising
- Cooperation requests (linking, sponsoring)
- Marketing SEO bullshit
- Newsletter
